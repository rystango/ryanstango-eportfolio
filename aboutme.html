    <p>Hi! My name is Ryan Stango and I am currently 19 years of age. Currently I live in New Jersey and plan to move to New York City in the spring of 2021. I work as a barista for Starbucks and love getting to make coffee and lattes for people everyday. My major as of now is business marketing and I plan to move into fashion marketing at FIT once I have my associates degree from the great school BMCC. You can find me working out at the gym, hanging out with friends, going into the city, and listening to my favorite artists such as Ariana Grande, Charli XCX, and SZA.</p>
